religious preachy exploitation if you want to hear you re ok it s good to be you after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters negative emotions then this is for you if you want a good sci fi flick that is simply fun to watch forget this one both the original and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me all that and this movie was too preachy

understand them absolutely this is not a movie for normal people with dreams and illusions a person that is living in his her dreams day by day not wanting to see all the horror in our life and on our planet will be very shocked by this film if someone reads this now who has seen s c and also thinks it s great just contact me so far i haven t met anyone who shares my opinion it d be cool this film

10 yrs since this movie was released still makes me laugh if u enjoy this film try the new hera pheri t is as hilarious and my favourite bit of the film must be when salman realises that he has no
